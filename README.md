# sqlalchemy-challenge
Description:
This is the homework challenge for module 10 of bootcamp, which focuses on SQLAlchemy.

The setting for this assingment is that I am planning a vacation to Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with planning, I am completing a climate analysis of the area. 

The first part of the challenge involves using Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis, specifically the amount of rainfall,  of the climate database.

In the second part of the assingment, I am tasked with creating a Flask API based on queries from the first part of the challenge.

Code:
A starter code was provided for both parts of the challenge. We had a brainstorming session with our instructor, as well as meeting with my tutor. I was having trouble with the final task in the API section, specifically with the dates in the API. I took ideas from the lessons we had in class to construct the majority of the code.
